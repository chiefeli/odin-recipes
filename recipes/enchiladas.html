<h2>Description</h2>
<p1>This recipe is for a variation of Nana B's famous enchiladas. It is a variation becuase the original recipce calls for
  homemade red salsa and I dont have that recipe LOL. Plus lets be honest even if I did, there is only one person who could recreate
  it. So we have to work with what we got - which is a shame becasue that red enchilada sacuce is to die for! Also, always top with
  an egg over easy!

<h3>Ingredient List</h3>
<p2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 white or yellow onion</li>
    <li>olives</li>
    <li>pork chops</li>
    <li>red enchilada sacue</li>
    <li>1 package of corn tortillas</li>
    <li>cooking oil</li>
    <li>shredded cheese</li>
    <li>egg</li>
  </ul>
</p2>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<p3>
  <ol>
    <li>Mince the pork into bite size peices. Place cooking oil in pan on medium high heat and cook until pork is
      colored on all sides. Be sure the pork is cooked all the way through.
    </li>
    <li>Pour in red enchilada sauce and heat until simmering. Once simmering, place on low and set aside.</li>
    <li>Dice onion and place inside smaller bowl. Cover and put aside in fridge.</li>
    <li>Grab an extra frying pan and pour in cooking oil, enough to put a thin layer of oil on the pan. Place on
      medium low heat.
    </li>
    <li>Take corn tortillas and being heating using the lightly oiled pan for roughly 30 sec. Once soft and heated,
      place on plate. Pour a serving spoon full of the sauce/pork mix over the tortilla, top with cheese, onions, and
      olives. Warm another tortilla and place on top, repeat process until you have reached your desired amount layers.
      (Usually around 3-4 for me, there should not be a tortilla topping the final layer).
    </li>
    <li>Once desired amount of layers is reached, set aside and pour cooking oil into a smaller frying pan on medium-high
      heat. Once hot, crack egg and cook till over easy. Once done, top  enchiladas with egg.
    </li>
    <li>serve and enjoy!</li>

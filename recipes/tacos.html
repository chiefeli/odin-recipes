<h3>Ingredient List</h3>
<p2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 white or yellow onion</li>
    <li>1/2 a head of lettuce</li>
    <li>1lb ground beef</li>
    <li>garlic seasoning salt</li>
    <li>1 package of corn tortillas</li>
    <li>cooking oil</li>
    <li>shredded cheese</li>
    <li>homemade salsa (optional but highly recommended)</li>
  </ul>
</p2>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<p3>
  <ol>
    <li>Unwrap the ground beef and place inside of a mixing bowl. Season ground beef generously
      with garlic seasoning salt and begin to mix the two together with your hand. Be sure to 
      thoroughly mix. Cover and set aside when done. 
    </li>
    <li>Chop the lettus into 1/4inch strips and place in a bowl. Cover when done and put aside in fridge.</li>
    <li>Dice onion and place inside smaller bowl. Cover and put aside in fridge.</li>
    <li>Take about 10 tortillas from the packaging and wrap inside of a kitchen towel. Pleace wrapped tortillas
      inside microwave and microwave for 15-25sec (until soft). You want to be able to bend the tortilla without
      breaking it.
    </li>
    <li>Unwrap the warmed tortillas and leave in a stack. Grab seasoned ground beef and place ground beef on one
      side of the tortilla (you should be able to bend the tortilla in half leaving no meat exposed). Place aside
      and begin to fill the remaining tortillas with the ground beef, stacking the completed batch.
    </li>
    <li>Once done. Get pan hot and pour cooking oil inside. (The goal here is to have enough oil in the pan to fry
      fry the tortilla. Once the oil is nice and hot, fold tortillas w/ meat and place inside the pan facing away
      from you. Flip the tortilla once crispy and meat is cooked to about half way. Flip and continue cooking until
      crispy and meat is fully cooked. Remove from pan and place in a try with paper towl to soak up any residual oil.
      Repeat until all tacos are made.
    </li>
    <li>To assemble, take out chopped lettuce and diced onions along with shredded cheese. Take one taco and open just
      enough to fill. Fill with lettuce, then cheese, then top with raw onion. Finally enojoy with some homemade salsa.
